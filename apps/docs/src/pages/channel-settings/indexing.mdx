# Indexing

## What it does

Indexes the content of your channel into search engines like Google.

Indexing occurs roughly ever 24 hours, although this may fluctuate depending on the number of servers Answer Overflow is in. This is to not overload the Discord API and to allow for questions to be solved before they are indexed.

	Indexing starts at the beginning of the channel and works its way to the most
	recent messages. It may take a few days for a channel to be fully indexed,
	however, once it is fully indexed it will be updated every 24 hours.

## Why you might want it

Incorporating your Discord server content into web search engines like Google enables users to easily discover information when searching for it. Without indexing, they would need to be aware of your server's existence and manually sift through its content to find answers related to your product. By reducing this friction, you can improve accessibility and user experience.

## Enabling

import {
	OPEN_INDEXING_SETTINGS_MENU_LABEL,
	ENABLE_CHANNEL_INDEXING_LABEL,
	DISABLE_CHANNEL_INDEXING_LABEL,
} from '@answeroverflow/constants';

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to enable indexing in. Click the **{OPEN_INDEXING_SETTINGS_MENU_LABEL}** menu and then click **{ENABLE_CHANNEL_INDEXING_LABEL}**

## Disabling

Use `/channel-settings` in the channel you want to disable indexing in. Click the **{OPEN_INDEXING_SETTINGS_MENU_LABEL}** menu and then click **{DISABLE_CHANNEL_INDEXING_LABEL}**

<Callout type="warning">
  Indexed content will persist on Answer Overflow for up to 7 days after disabling indexing. This is to prevent people from accidentally wiping out their indexed content.
  
  Additionally, the content may persist in Google search results for an unspecified duration, as Google's indexing process operates independently of Answer Overflow.

## Indexing FAQ

##### I see my server questions on Answer Overflow, but cannot find them on Google.

It's great that your server questions appear on Answer Overflow, but unfortunately, Answer Overflow does not have control over whether they show up on Google. When content is submitted to Google through a sitemap, it's ultimately up to Google to assess its relevance and quality before deciding to index it

To have the best chance of your questions being indexed, try the following:

- Make sure your help channels are following the [recommended format](/recommended-setup).
- Enable [read the rules consent](/server-settings/read-the-rules-consent) and [forum guidelines consent](/channel-settings/forum-guidelines-consent) to get the most indexable content.
- Sign up for [Answer Overflow Pro](https://answeroverflow.com/pricing) to index content on your on domain to not compete with other Discord servers that are hosting their content on [answeroverflow.com](https://answeroverflow.com).
